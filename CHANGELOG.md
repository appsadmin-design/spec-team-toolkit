## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-08

### Changed

- `hld-builder` skill reworked around incremental, multi-session drafting: the HLD is now built from two durable artifacts (`scope-list.md` and `hld-draft.md`) that carry state between sessions, with a session-start protocol that resumes from existing files instead of restarting discovery.
- Discovery questions are now a fixed script (`references/discovery_questions.md`) so the process is identical across analysts, with conditional sections gated by signals from the answers.
- Drafting now follows the team's real HLD template (`references/hld_template_structure.md`, with the exact Hebrew section headers) and its status-tag / change-tracking conventions (`references/draft_conventions.md`), instead of a generic Business/Functional/Information-Model structure.
- QA self-review against the checklist now runs only when the draft is finalized for delivery, rather than as part of a single one-shot generation.

### Added

- `skills/hld-builder/references/discovery_questions.md` — the fixed discovery question script.
- `skills/hld-builder/references/draft_conventions.md` — status tags, open-question notes, and change-log conventions for the working draft.
- `skills/hld-builder/references/hld_template_structure.md` — the team's real HLD section structure and headers.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- Initial release of the spec-team-toolkit plugin.
- `hld-builder` skill: discovers and scopes a High Level Design (HLD) through guided conversation, self-reviews it against the team's QA checklist, and produces a customer-facing Word document ready for approval.
- `lld-figma-spec` skill: turns a Figma web component design into the team's two-part Low Level Design spec — an Umbraco CMS content-entry spec and a display/behavior spec — for handoff to developers and QA, pulling design data directly from Figma via MCP.
